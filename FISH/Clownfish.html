        <p>
            Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, are small marine fish belonging to the subfamily <i>Amphiprioninae</i>. They are native to the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including the Great Barrier Reef and the Red Sea.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Classification</h2>
        <p>
            Clownfish are members of the family <i>Pomacentridae</i>. There are about 30 species of clownfish, the most well-known being the orange and white <i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i>, popularized in movies like "Finding Nemo."
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Clownfish are easily recognizable by their bright orange bodies with white bands outlined in black. Their coloration serves as camouflage within sea anemones, their primary habitat.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Characteristic</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Size</td>
                <td>2 to 5 inches (5 to 12 cm)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Color</td>
                <td>Orange with white bands (most species)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Habitat</td>
                <td>Tropical coral reefs</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Symbiotic Relationship</h2>
        <p>
            Clownfish have a mutualistic relationship with sea anemones. The fish gain protection from predators by living within the stinging tentacles of the anemone, while the anemone benefits from the clownfish's cleaning and increased water circulation.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Clownfish are social creatures, living in small groups within a single anemone. They are omnivores, feeding on plankton, algae, and small invertebrates.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Clownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning they can change sex. The dominant individual in a group becomes female, while others remain male. Eggs are laid on a flat surface near the anemone and are guarded by the male.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            While clownfish are not currently endangered, their populations are threatened by habitat destruction and overharvesting for the aquarium trade. Conservation efforts focus on protecting coral reefs and regulating trade.
