        <h1>Tuna</h1>

        <p>
            Tuna are a group of large, fast-swimming marine fish found in warm and temperate oceans worldwide. They belong to the family <i>Scombridae</i> and are highly prized for their commercial and recreational value.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Classification</h2>
        <p>
            The genus <i>Thunnus</i> contains the true tunas, including species such as bluefin, yellowfin, and albacore tuna. There are eight primary species of tuna, which vary significantly in size and habitat preferences.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Tuna are streamlined, powerful swimmers capable of traveling great distances. Their metallic, torpedo-shaped bodies are designed for speed and endurance in the open ocean.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Characteristic</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Size</td>
                <td>Up to 15 feet (4.6 m) in length</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>Can exceed 1,500 pounds (680 kg)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Habitat</td>
                <td>Open oceans and coastal areas</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            Tuna are carnivorous predators that feed on smaller fish, squid, and crustaceans. They are known for their exceptional vision and ability to chase down fast-moving prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Migration</h2>
        <p>
            Tuna are highly migratory and often travel thousands of miles to breed and find food. Their extensive migrations make them a key species in marine ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Tuna is a cornerstone of the global seafood industry. Bluefin tuna, in particular, is highly sought after for sushi and sashimi. However, overfishing has led to significant population declines in some species.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Conservation efforts focus on sustainable fishing practices and habitat protection. Organizations such as the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) work to ensure tuna populations are managed responsibly.
