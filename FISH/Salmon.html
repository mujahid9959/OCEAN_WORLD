        <p>
            Salmon are a group of fish in the family <i>Salmonidae</i>, known for their ability to migrate between freshwater and marine environments. They are popular for their ecological, cultural, and culinary importance.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Classification</h2>
        <p>
            Salmon belong to the order <i>Salmoniformes</i>. They are closely related to trout, chars, and graylings. The most well-known species of salmon include the Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) and several species of Pacific salmon in the genus <i>Oncorhynchus</i>.
        </p>

        <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>
            Salmon are anadromous, meaning they hatch in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow and mature, and return to freshwater to spawn. After spawning, most salmon die, providing nutrients to the ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Characteristic</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Size</td>
                <td>Varies by species; can range from 2 to 5 feet in length</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>Up to 126 pounds (record for Chinook salmon)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Color</td>
                <td>Varies from silver to reddish depending on the species and life stage</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Diet and Predators</h2>
        <p>
            Salmon primarily feed on plankton, small fish, and invertebrates. They are preyed upon by bears, eagles, and larger fish, making them a key link in many ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic and Cultural Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Salmon are widely harvested for commercial and recreational purposes. They hold cultural significance for many Indigenous peoples and are an essential part of the global seafood market.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change pose threats to wild salmon populations. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration, sustainable fisheries management, and hatchery programs.
