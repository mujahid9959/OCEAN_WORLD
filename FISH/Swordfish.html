        <h1>Swordfish</h1>

    <main>
        <p>
            The swordfish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>), also known as the broadbill, is a large, predatory fish characterized by its long, flat bill. Found in tropical and temperate oceans around the world, swordfish are highly migratory and are known for their speed and agility.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Classification</h2>
        <p>
            Swordfish belong to the family <i>Xiphiidae</i> and are the sole member of the genus <i>Xiphias</i>. They are closely related to marlins and other billfish species.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Swordfish are named for their elongated, sword-like bill, which they use to slash at prey and reduce resistance while swimming at high speeds. Their streamlined bodies make them one of the fastest swimmers in the ocean.
        </p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            Swordfish are carnivorous predators that feed on a variety of smaller fish and squid. Their speed and agility, combined with their sharp bill, make them efficient hunters.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Migration</h2>
        <p>
            Swordfish are solitary swimmers and highly migratory. They are known to traverse vast distances, often following warm ocean currents to find prey and suitable breeding grounds.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic and Culinary Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Swordfish are a popular choice for sport fishing and commercial fisheries. Their firm, meaty texture and mild flavor make them a staple in many seafood dishes. Overfishing and bycatch concerns have led to increased regulation in many regions.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Efforts to protect swordfish populations focus on sustainable fishing practices and international management agreements. Conservation organizations aim to prevent overexploitation while maintaining healthy marine ecosystems.
