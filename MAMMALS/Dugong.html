        <p>
            The <strong>Dugong</strong> (<i>Dugong dugon</i>) is a marine mammal belonging to the order Sirenia, which also includes manatees. It is the only extant species in the family Dugongidae. Dugongs are herbivorous and primarily graze on seagrass beds in warm coastal waters.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Dugongs have a fusiform body shape with a broad, horizontal tail fluke similar to that of a whale. Their bodies are covered in thick, smooth skin, and they have paddle-like forelimbs. Adults can reach lengths of up to 3 meters (10 feet) and weigh over 400 kilograms (880 pounds).
        </p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Dugongs inhabit shallow, warm coastal waters in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and western Pacific. They are most commonly found in areas with extensive seagrass meadows, which are their primary food source.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            Dugongs are slow-moving, gentle animals that spend most of their time grazing on seagrass. They are typically solitary but can form small groups. Their feeding activities play a crucial role in maintaining healthy seagrass ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The dugong is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Threats to their survival include habitat loss, hunting, entanglement in fishing gear, and boat collisions. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats and mitigating human impacts.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dugongs are closely related to elephants, as both belong to the clade Afrotheria.</li>
            <li>The word "dugong" comes from the Malay term "duyung," meaning "lady of the sea."</li>
            <li>Dugongs can hold their breath for up to six minutes while foraging underwater.</li>
