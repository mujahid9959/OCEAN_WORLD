        <p>
            A <strong>dolphin</strong> is a marine mammal belonging to the family <i>Delphinidae</i>, which is part of the cetacean order that also includes whales and porpoises. Dolphins are known for their playful behavior, high intelligence, and social nature. They are found in oceans and rivers worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Dolphins are primarily found in deep, warm oceanic waters, but there are also some species that inhabit freshwater environments. The family <i>Delphinidae</i> includes around 90 species of dolphins, such as the common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, and orca (killer whale).

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Communication</h2>
        <p>
            Dolphins are highly social animals, often living in groups called pods. They are known for their sophisticated communication skills, using a combination of whistles, clicks, and body language to convey information and maintain group cohesion. They also exhibit problem-solving abilities, tool use, and cooperative hunting.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            While some dolphin species are abundant, others are endangered due to human activities such as fishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Conservation efforts are underway to protect dolphin populations, including establishing marine protected areas and regulating fishing practices.
        </p>
