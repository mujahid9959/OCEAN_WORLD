        <p>
            The <strong>Blue Whale</strong> (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>) is the largest known animal to have ever existed, both in terms of length and weight. These majestic marine mammals are found in oceans around the world and are known for their long, streamlined bodies and characteristic blue-gray coloration.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Blue whales belong to the family Balaenopteridae, which also includes other large baleen whales like the humpback whale and the fin whale. They are distributed in all major oceans but are most commonly found in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific.
        </p>

                <td>Baleen plates filter small organisms like krill</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Blue whales are migratory and typically travel between feeding grounds in cold waters and breeding areas in warmer waters. They are primarily solitary, although they can occasionally be found in small groups. Despite their immense size, they feed almost exclusively on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, consuming several tons per day during feeding seasons.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The blue whale population has drastically declined due to hunting in the 20th century. However, they are now protected under international law, and their numbers are slowly recovering. They are currently listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
