        <p>
            The <strong>whale</strong> (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>) is the largest toothed whale and one of the most iconic marine mammals. Known for its massive head and prominent rounded forehead, the sperm whale is widely distributed in all the world’s oceans.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Sperm whales are among the largest marine mammals, with males reaching lengths of up to 20.5 meters (67 feet) and weighing over 57,000 kilograms (125,000 pounds). Females are typically smaller, measuring up to 12 meters (39 feet). Their heads constitute up to one-third of their total body length.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Sperm whales are deep-diving mammals, capable of descending to depths of over 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) in search of prey. They are found in all the world’s oceans, with a preference for deep waters. Sperm whales live in matrilineal groups called pods, typically composed of females and their young.
        </p>

        <h2>Communication and Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Sperm whales use echolocation and a series of loud clicks to communicate and navigate. These sounds, known as codas, are unique to individual whales and are believed to represent a complex form of communication.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The sperm whale is currently classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They were heavily hunted during the whaling era for their oil and spermaceti, a waxy substance found in their heads. Conservation efforts are now in place to protect these magnificent creatures.
