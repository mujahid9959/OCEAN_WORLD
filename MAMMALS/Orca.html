        <h1>Orca (Killer Whale)</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>orca</strong> (<i>Orcinus orca</i>), also known as the killer whale, is a toothed whale belonging to the dolphin family, Delphinidae. Orcas are highly social and are found in oceans around the world, from the Arctic to the Antarctic.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Orcas are easily recognizable due to their black-and-white coloration and tall dorsal fins. Males can grow up to 9 meters (30 feet) in length and weigh as much as 6,000 kilograms (13,000 pounds), while females are slightly smaller.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Characteristic</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Size</td>
                <td>Up to 9 meters (30 feet) for males</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>Up to 6,000 kilograms (13,000 pounds) for males</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Color</td>
                <td>Black with white patches on the belly and near the eyes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Diet</td>
                <td>Varied: fish, squid, seals, and even other whales</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Orcas are highly intelligent and social animals, living in groups called pods. These pods often have complex social structures and use vocalizations to communicate. Orcas are apex predators and exhibit unique hunting techniques, including coordinated attacks and beaching to catch prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Ecotypes</h2>
        <p>
            Orcas can be classified into distinct ecotypes based on their diet, behavior, and habitat. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resident Orcas:</strong> Primarily feed on fish and have complex social bonds.</li>
            <li><strong>Transient Orcas:</strong> Feed on marine mammals and are more solitary.</li>
            <li><strong>Offshore Orcas:</strong> Feed on fish and sharks, living far from the coast.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Orcas are not currently endangered, but some populations are at risk due to habitat loss, pollution, and declining prey availability. For example, the Southern Resident orcas in the Pacific Northwest are critically endangered.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Orcas are the largest members of the dolphin family.</li>
            <li>They can swim at speeds of up to 56 km/h (34.8 mph).</li>
            <li>Orcas have a wide range of vocalizations, with dialects specific to each pod.</li>
        </ul>
