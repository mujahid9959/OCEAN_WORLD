        <h1>Seahorse</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>seahorse</strong> is a small marine fish belonging to the genus <em>Hippocampus</em>, named for its distinctive horse-like head. Known for their unique body shape, seahorses are characterized by their upright posture, small size, and elongated, curved bodies. There are approximately 70 species of seahorses, mostly found in shallow waters, coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Seahorses have a bony, armored body with a series of rings running along their back. Their heads resemble that of a horse, with a long snout used to feed by sucking in small invertebrates and plankton. Unlike most fish, seahorses lack scales; instead, their skin is covered with tiny, spiny plates. They are also known for their prehensile tail, which they use to anchor themselves to vegetation or corals in the water.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Seahorses are unique among fish because of their mating and reproductive behavior. During mating, the male seahorse carries the fertilized eggs in a specialized brood pouch until they hatch. Once the eggs hatch, the male "gives birth" to fully developed miniature seahorses. This role reversal, where the male plays the nurturing role of carrying the eggs, is a rare trait in the animal kingdom.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Seahorses are found in a variety of marine environments, including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove swamps. They prefer shallow waters and are often found in coastal areas. Seahorses are opportunistic feeders, using their long snouts to suck in plankton, small crustaceans, and other tiny invertebrates from the water. Their diet consists primarily of shrimp, copepods, and other small aquatic animals.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Many seahorse species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and the aquarium trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists several species of seahorses as vulnerable or endangered. As a result, various conservation efforts have been initiated to protect their habitats and reduce their exploitation.
