        <h1>Anglerfish</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Anglerfish</strong> refers to a group of deep-sea fish species known for their distinctive feature: a bioluminescent lure that dangles in front of their heads to attract prey. These fish are famous for their grotesque appearance and unusual feeding habits. They are mostly found in deep ocean waters, where they have evolved to survive in extremely low-light environments.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Anglerfish are recognized for their bioluminescent lure, which is an extension of their dorsal spine. This lure glows due to a chemical reaction within specialized cells, attracting smaller fish and invertebrates. The anglerfish’s body is typically robust and equipped with large jaws and sharp teeth, which help them capture prey. Many anglerfish species have large mouths capable of expanding to swallow prey that is even larger than themselves.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Anglerfish are carnivorous, primarily preying on smaller fish and invertebrates. The bioluminescent lure plays a crucial role in attracting prey, luring them close enough for the anglerfish to strike. Some species of anglerfish have been known to consume other fish of their kind, exhibiting cannibalistic behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Anglerfish are primarily found in deep-sea environments, typically at depths between 200 and 2,000 meters. They are adapted to life in the cold, dark depths of the ocean, where the bioluminescent lure serves as their primary means of communication and hunting. Some species are found in shallow waters, but these are relatively rare.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Anglerfish reproduction is particularly fascinating. In some species, males are much smaller than females and may attach themselves to the female’s body, becoming parasitic. The male then loses its organs and fuses with the female, providing sperm whenever needed. This unique form of reproduction ensures that females can always find a mate in the vast, isolated deep-sea environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            While many anglerfish species are not considered endangered, the deep-sea ecosystems they inhabit are increasingly threatened by deep-sea trawling and habitat destruction. However, due to their elusive nature and remote habitats, anglerfish are not as heavily impacted by human activities as other species.
