        <h1>Barracuda</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>barracuda</strong> is a predatory fish known for its long, slender body and sharp teeth. It belongs to the family <em>Exocoetidae</em> and is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical oceans. Barracudas are opportunistic hunters, capable of reaching speeds up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h), making them formidable predators. They are typically found near the surface of warm waters but can also inhabit deeper areas.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Barracudas are easily recognized by their elongated bodies and large jaws filled with sharp, triangular teeth. They are usually silver or blue-gray in color, which helps them blend into the water while hunting. Their streamlined bodies are built for fast swimming, allowing them to ambush their prey with sudden bursts of speed.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Barracudas are carnivorous and primarily feed on smaller fish such as jacks, grunts, and snapper. They hunt in a solitary manner, often ambushing prey by lurking in wait and attacking with rapid acceleration. They are known to exhibit bold behavior, sometimes approaching divers or boats, though they generally pose no significant danger unless provoked.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Barracudas are found in warm, coastal waters worldwide, including the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Indo-Pacific region. They typically prefer coral reefs, rocky outcroppings, and seagrass beds where they can find an abundance of prey. They are also capable of migrating over long distances in search of food.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Although barracudas are not currently endangered, they face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Their population remains stable in many regions, but they are subject to catch limits in some areas to ensure sustainable fishing practices.
