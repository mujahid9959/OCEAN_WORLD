        <p>
            The <strong>Common Squid</strong>, also referred to as the <i>European squid</i> (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>), is a widely distributed cephalopod mollusk found in coastal waters and open oceans. Known for its streamlined body, tentacles, and exceptional swimming speed, the common squid is a fascinating marine animal.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Common Squid has a torpedo-shaped body, known as the mantle, which is designed for fast swimming. Its arms and tentacles are equipped with suction cups for capturing prey and defense.
        </p>

            <tr>

                <td>Reddish or pinkish with a translucent body</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Diet</td>
                <td>Small fish, crustaceans, and other marine organisms</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            This species is commonly found in the Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, and along the western coast of Europe. It typically inhabits depths ranging from 20 to 250 meters (65 to 820 feet).
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            The Common Squid is a highly active and social creature, often found in schools. It uses jet propulsion to move through the water and can release ink to escape predators. Its ability to rapidly change color is used for communication and camouflage.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Squid reproduction involves males transferring spermatophores to females using a specialized arm. Females lay hundreds to thousands of eggs in clusters attached to underwater surfaces. The hatchlings, known as paralarvae, resemble miniature adults.
        </p>

        <h2>Ecological and Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
            The Common Squid plays a vital role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey. It is also an important resource for fisheries and is consumed in various cuisines around the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Squid can swim at speeds of up to 40 km/h (25 mph) using jet propulsion.</li>
            <li>They have highly developed eyes, often compared to those of vertebrates.</li>
            <li>Squid ink contains melanin and is used both for defense and as a culinary ingredient.</li>
