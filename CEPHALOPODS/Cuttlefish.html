        <p>
            The <strong>Cuttlefish</strong> is a marine mollusk belonging to the class <i>Cephalopoda</i>, which also includes squids, octopuses, and nautiluses. Known for their intelligence, unique appearance, and remarkable ability to change color, cuttlefish are fascinating creatures of the sea.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Cuttlefish are characterized by their broad, flattened bodies, large eyes, and eight arms along with two longer tentacles for capturing prey. They possess an internal shell called the cuttlebone, which helps regulate buoyancy.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Cuttlefish are found in temperate and tropical marine waters worldwide, typically in shallow coastal areas. They can inhabit depths ranging from a few meters to over 600 meters (2,000 feet).
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Cuttlefish are highly intelligent and use their ability to change color for communication, camouflage, and hunting. Their chromatophores (specialized pigment cells) enable them to blend into their surroundings or display vibrant patterns.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            During mating, males transfer spermatophores to females using a specialized arm. Females lay eggs in protected areas, such as under rocks or coral. The eggs hatch into small, fully formed cuttlefish, requiring no parental care.
        </p>

        <h2>Ecological and Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Cuttlefish play a significant role in marine food webs as both predator and prey. They are also harvested for their meat and cuttlebones, which are used in bird care and traditional medicines.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cuttlefish have three hearts and blue-green blood, which contains copper-based hemocyanin.</li>
            <li>They are known to be one of the most intelligent invertebrates.</li>
            <li>Their cuttlebones are often used as a calcium source for pet birds.</li>
