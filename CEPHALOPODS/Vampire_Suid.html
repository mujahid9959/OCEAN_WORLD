        <p>
            The <strong>Vampire Squid</strong> (<em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>) is a small, deep-sea cephalopod that inhabits oxygen-depleted areas of the ocean at extreme depths. Despite its name and appearance, the Vampire Squid is neither a true squid nor a bloodsucker. Instead, it is a fascinating species uniquely adapted to its dark, high-pressure habitat.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Vampire Squid is known for its gelatinous, umbrella-like body and dark red or black coloration. It has large eyes, which can appear red or blue depending on the light. Its most distinctive feature is its "cape," a webbing of skin connecting its arms, lined with spiny projections.
        </p>

            </tr>

                <td>Estimated 8 to 10 years</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Vampire Squids are found in the mesopelagic to bathypelagic zones of the world's temperate and tropical oceans. They are uniquely adapted to thrive in oxygen minimum zones, where few other animals can survive.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike predatory squids, Vampire Squids feed on "marine snow," a mixture of detritus, fecal matter, and organic debris falling from the upper layers of the ocean. They use their filament-like feeding appendages to collect particles from the water.
        </p>

        <h2>Defensive Adaptations</h2>
        <p>
            When threatened, the Vampire Squid turns its webbed arms inside out, exposing rows of spines and creating a spiky ball-like appearance. It can also emit bioluminescent mucus to confuse predators and make its escape.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The Vampire Squid is not currently considered endangered. Its remote habitat offers some protection from human activity, though deep-sea mining and climate change could pose future threats.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Vampire Squid's scientific name, <em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>, translates to "vampire squid from hell."</li>
            <li>It has one of the largest eye-to-body size ratios in the animal kingdom.</li>
            <li>Its bioluminescent organs, called photophores, can flash light to startle or distract predators.</li>
