            The <strong>Giant Pacific Octopus</strong> (<i>Enteroctopus dofleini</i>) is the largest species of octopus in the world. Native to the North Pacific Ocean, it is known for its incredible intelligence, unique appearance, and adaptability to various marine environments.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Giant Pacific Octopus is a cephalopod mollusk characterized by its bulbous head, eight powerful arms, and a soft, boneless body. Adult individuals can weigh up to 50 kilograms (110 pounds) and have an arm span of over 4 meters (13 feet).

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            The Giant Pacific Octopus inhabits the coastal waters of the North Pacific Ocean, from Japan to Alaska and down to California. It thrives in diverse marine habitats, including rocky reefs, kelp forests, and ocean depths up to 1,500 meters (4,920 feet).
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Known for its remarkable intelligence, the Giant Pacific Octopus can solve puzzles, open jars, and even recognize individual humans. It is a solitary and nocturnal hunter, relying on its excellent camouflage and dexterous arms to catch prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Females lay up to 74,000 eggs during a single breeding season. They guard and care for the eggs until they hatch, often not eating during this period. After the eggs hatch, the female dies, a phenomenon known as semelparity.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The Giant Pacific Octopus is not currently listed as endangered. However, threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change may impact its population in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Giant Pacific Octopus has three hearts and blue blood, which helps it survive in cold, oxygen-poor waters.</li>
            <li>It can regenerate lost arms.</li>
            <li>The octopus uses its siphon to jet through water at high speeds when escaping predators.</li>
