        <p>
            The <strong>Blue-Ringed Octopus</strong> is a small but highly venomous marine animal found in tide pools and coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Despite its small size, it is one of the most dangerous animals in the ocean due to the potent neurotoxin it produces.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Blue-Ringed Octopuses are easily recognizable by their bright blue rings that appear when they feel threatened. Their bodies are soft and flexible, allowing them to squeeze into tiny crevices.
        </p>

            <tr>
                <th>Characteristic</th>
                <th>Description</th>

                <td>10 to 100 grams</td>

                <td>Venom</td>
                <td>Tetrodotoxin</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Blue-Ringed Octopuses are found in the shallow coastal waters of Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. They inhabit tide pools, coral reefs, and seagrass beds.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            These octopuses are shy and reclusive, hiding in crevices during the day. They are most active at night, hunting small crustaceans and fish. When threatened, their blue rings become vividly iridescent as a warning signal to predators.
        </p>

        <h2>Venom and Danger to Humans</h2>
        <p>
            The Blue-Ringed Octopus produces tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin that can cause paralysis and respiratory failure in humans. Despite this, bites are rare and typically occur when the octopus is handled or provoked.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            While not currently endangered, habitat destruction and climate change pose threats to their populations. Their striking appearance also makes them a target for collectors.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite their deadly venom, they are not aggressive and will only bite in self-defense.</li>
            <li>They lack an ink sac, relying instead on camouflage and their warning display to deter predators.</li>
            <li>Their venom is 1,000 times more potent than cyanide and can kill 26 adult humans within minutes.</li>
        </ul>
