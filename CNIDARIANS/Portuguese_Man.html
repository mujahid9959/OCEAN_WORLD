        <h1>Portuguese Man o' War</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Portuguese Man o' War</strong> (scientific name: <i>Physalia physalis</i>) is a marine organism known for its striking appearance and powerful sting. Despite its appearance, it is not a true jellyfish but a colonial organism made up of four individuals that function together as a single unit.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Portuguese Man o' War is recognized for its translucent, sail-like float (called a pneumatophore) that sits above the water's surface. The float is typically a deep blue or purple color. It can grow up to 30 cm (12 inches) in length. Beneath the float are long, venomous tentacles that can extend up to 10 meters (33 feet) and are used to capture prey and defend the organism.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            These creatures are typically found in warm ocean waters, particularly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They are often carried by winds and currents and can be found floating near the surface of the water, usually in groups.
        </p>

        <h2>Sting and Venom</h2>
        <p>
            The Portuguese Man o' War's sting can cause intense pain and potentially dangerous reactions in humans. Its venom is used to paralyze and capture small fish and invertebrates. While not usually lethal to humans, it can cause severe pain, allergic reactions, and in some cases, systemic effects.
        </p>

        <h2>Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            The Portuguese Man o' War feeds primarily on small fish, plankton, and other marine organisms that get caught in its tentacles. The venom paralyzes the prey, allowing the individual polyps to bring the food to their mouths for digestion.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Reproduction occurs through sexual and asexual means. Portuguese Man o' War colonies consist of different polyps, each specialized for different tasks, such as feeding, defense, or reproduction. The gonozooids release sperm and eggs into the water, where fertilization occurs.
