        <h1>Moon Jellyfish</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            The <strong>Moon Jellyfish</strong> (<em>Aurelia aurita</em>) is one of the most common and widely recognized species of jellyfish. It is known for its translucent, bell-shaped body, which is typically about 25-40 cm (10-16 inches) in diameter, with a characteristic white, moon-like appearance. The species is found in oceans worldwide, typically in coastal waters. Moon jellyfish are harmless to humans, despite their stinging cells, which are generally not strong enough to cause serious harm.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Moon Jellyfish's bell is made up of a soft, transparent, gelatinous substance that can range in color from clear to a light blue or purple hue. The bell's edge often has a fringe of fine tentacles, while inside the bell, four large, horseshoe-shaped gonads are visible, giving the jellyfish its characteristic "moon" appearance. They use their tentacles, which contain stinging cells (nematocysts), to capture food such as plankton, small fish, and other microscopic organisms.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Moon jellyfish are found in coastal waters all around the world, including temperate and tropical oceans. They often inhabit shallow bays, estuaries, and harbors, where they thrive on plankton and small organisms. They are commonly seen in large groups, known as blooms, especially during warm weather when conditions are favorable.
        </p>

        <h2>Feeding and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            These jellyfish are filter feeders, using their tentacles to capture small prey from the water. Their diet consists mostly of plankton, including small crustaceans, and fish larvae. While their stinging cells are capable of paralyzing small prey, they have little effect on humans. In fact, their sting is often described as a mild, tingling sensation, which is not dangerous for most people.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Moon Jellyfish has a fascinating lifecycle, beginning as a fertilized egg that develops into a free-swimming larva known as a planula. This larva then settles on the seabed and develops into a polyp, which can reproduce asexually. Eventually, the polyp transforms into the medusa form, the familiar adult jellyfish. Reproduction is sexual, with males releasing sperm and females releasing eggs into the water during the breeding season.

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Moon Jellyfish is one of the most common jellyfish species found in the world’s oceans.</li>
            <li>Despite their abundance, Moon Jellyfish are not harmful to humans, making them a popular attraction in aquariums.</li>
            <li>Moon Jellyfish have been known to form large blooms, sometimes reaching millions of individuals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Moon Jellyfish and Humans</h2>
        <p>
            Although their stings are not harmful, Moon Jellyfish can sometimes cause discomfort if they come into contact with human skin. In areas where jellyfish populations are high, their blooms can sometimes disrupt local fishing and tourism industries.
