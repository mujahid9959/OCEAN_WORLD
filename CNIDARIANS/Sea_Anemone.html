        <h1>Sea Anemone</h1>

        <p>
            A <strong>Sea Anemone</strong> is a predatory marine invertebrate belonging to the order <em>Actiniaria</em>, which is part of the phylum Cnidaria. These colorful creatures are found in oceans worldwide and are known for their tentacles that contain venomous cells called nematocysts. When triggered, these cells can paralyze prey, which is then consumed by the anemone.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Sea Anemones are typically attached to the ocean floor, rocks, or coral, although some species can move. They have a cylindrical body topped with a central mouth surrounded by numerous tentacles. The tentacles contain specialized cells that release venom to capture and immobilize prey such as small fish and plankton. Their appearance can vary from one species to another, with colors ranging from vibrant hues to more subdued tones.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Sea Anemones are found in both shallow and deep ocean habitats. They live in a wide range of environments, from coral reefs to sandy shores and rocky outcroppings. Some species are even found in cold deep-sea regions. Most Sea Anemones live in warm tropical and subtropical waters, but they can also be found in temperate zones.
        </p>

        <h2>Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            Sea Anemones are carnivorous and primarily feed on small fish, crustaceans, and plankton. They use their venomous tentacles to immobilize and capture prey before pulling it into their central mouth. Sea Anemones also benefit from a symbiotic relationship with certain species of fish, such as the Clownfish, which seek shelter among the anemoneâ€™s stinging tentacles.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Sea Anemones can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction typically occurs through budding, where a new individual forms from the parent organism. Sexual reproduction involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water, where fertilization occurs externally. The fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae, which settle on the ocean floor and mature into adult anemones.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea Anemones are named after the terrestrial flower, the anemone, because of their appearance.</li>
            <li>Some species of Sea Anemones can live for many years, with some individuals known to survive for decades.</li>
            <li>They are known for their vibrant colors, which are often the result of the symbiotic algae that live within their tissues.</li>
            <li>Clownfish are famously immune to the stings of Sea Anemones, thanks to a mucus coating on their skin that protects them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sea Anemone and Humans</h2>
        <p>
            While Sea Anemones are not typically dangerous to humans, their stings can cause discomfort and irritation. In certain cases, some species have venom that can cause severe reactions, especially if the stings are numerous or if a person is allergic to the toxins.
