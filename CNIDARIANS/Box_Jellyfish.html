        <h1>Box Jellyfish</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            The <strong>Box Jellyfish</strong> (<em>Cubomedusa</em>) is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth. Known for its cube-shaped bell, this jellyfish has tentacles that can stretch up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length. Found primarily in the waters of the Indo-Pacific and northern Australia, Box Jellyfish can deliver a deadly sting, causing heart failure and even death in extreme cases.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Box Jellyfish is distinguished by its cube-like shape, which is where it gets its name. Unlike most other jellyfish, its body is square-shaped, with tentacles extending from each of the four corners. These tentacles are covered in thousands of venomous nematocysts (stinging cells) capable of inflicting excruciating pain and potentially lethal consequences. The box jellyfish is usually transparent, which makes it harder to see in the water.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Box Jellyfish are typically found in coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region, including the northern coasts of Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. They are commonly spotted in shallow waters, especially near beaches, where they often pose a significant risk to swimmers and fishermen.
        </p>

        <h2>Venom and Stings</h2>
        <p>
            Box Jellyfish are infamous for their venom, which contains toxins capable of causing severe pain, paralysis, and even death. The venom affects the heart, nervous system, and skin. It can result in cardiac arrest within just a few minutes. Stings from these jellyfish require immediate medical attention, and in some regions, vinegar is used to neutralize the venom to reduce further stings from the tentacles.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            The life cycle of the Box Jellyfish involves both sexual and asexual stages. The adult jellyfish (medusa) produces eggs and sperm that meet in the water. After fertilization, the larvae develop into polyps, which attach to surfaces on the seafloor. These polyps then produce new juvenile jellyfish, which eventually grow into adult medusas.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Box Jellyfish's venom is so potent that it is considered one of the most dangerous marine animals in the world.</li>
            <li>Despite their deadly nature, Box Jellyfish are rarely encountered by humans due to their preference for deep waters.</li>
            <li>The Box Jellyfish's tentacles can continue to sting even after the jellyfish has died, which is why caution is advised even with dead specimens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Box Jellyfish and Humans</h2>
        <p>
            While the Box Jellyfish is a danger to humans, efforts are made to reduce encounters, including warning signs at beaches where they are known to frequent. Despite their danger, Box Jellyfish are not aggressive and typically only sting in self-defense. In many cases, fatalities from Box Jellyfish stings can be prevented with prompt medical intervention.
