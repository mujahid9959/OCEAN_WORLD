        <p>
            The <strong>Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake</strong> (<i>Pelamis platura</i>) is a species of venomous sea snake found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters. These snakes are highly adapted to life in the ocean and are capable of swimming long distances.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            The Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake is primarily found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, particularly in the coastal waters of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the East Coast of Africa. It prefers the open sea and is rarely seen on land.
        </p>

        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            The Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake is highly adapted for swimming, with a flattened, paddle-like tail that allows it to glide efficiently through the water. It is typically found in shallow coastal areas and is often observed near coral reefs or floating debris.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many other sea snakes, the Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake is pelagic, meaning it spends much of its time drifting in the open ocean. It relies on its venom to immobilize and capture its prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake is not considered endangered, but its population is threatened by habitat degradation, pollution, and accidental bycatch in fishing nets.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is one of the most common sea snakes found in the open ocean.</li>
            <li>The venom of the Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake is potent, but it is typically not dangerous to humans unless provoked.</li>
            <li>They are known for their ability to survive in water for extended periods, coming to the surface only for air.</li>
