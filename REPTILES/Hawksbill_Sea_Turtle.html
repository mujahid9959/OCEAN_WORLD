        <h1>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h1>

        <p>
            The Hawksbill sea turtle (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>) is a critically endangered species of marine turtle. It is known for its beautifully patterned shell and its importance to coral reef ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Hawksbill turtles are found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They prefer coral reefs and rocky areas where sponges, their primary food source, are abundant.
        </p>

                <th>Characteristic</th>

                <td>Size</td>
                <td>Approximately 2.5 to 3 feet in length</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>80 to 150 pounds</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Shell</td>
                <td>Amber with streaks of brown, black, and yellow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Beak</td>
                <td>Pointed and curved, resembling a hawk's beak</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Hawksbill turtles primarily feed on sponges, but they also consume other invertebrates, algae, and seagrasses. Their sharp, hooked beak allows them to extract prey from crevices in coral reefs.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Female Hawksbill turtles nest every 2 to 3 years, laying around 140 eggs per clutch. Nesting usually occurs on tropical beaches at night, and hatchlings face numerous threats as they make their way to the ocean.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            The Hawksbill sea turtle is critically endangered due to habitat destruction, illegal trade of its shell, bycatch, and climate change. Conservation measures include protecting nesting sites, banning the trade of turtle products, and creating marine protected areas.
