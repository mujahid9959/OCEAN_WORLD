        <p>
            The green sea turtle (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) is a species of large marine turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae. They are named for the green color of their body fat, which comes from their herbivorous diet.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Green sea turtles are found in tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. They migrate long distances between feeding grounds and the beaches where they nest. The major nesting sites include Florida, Australia, and the Gal√°pagos Islands.
        </p>

            <tr>
                <td>Shell</td>
                <td>Heart-shaped, smooth, and olive-green or brown in color</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Adult green sea turtles are herbivorous, primarily eating seagrasses and algae. Juveniles, however, may eat small invertebrates. These turtles are solitary and can stay submerged for hours while resting or sleeping.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Female turtles return to the same beach where they were born to lay eggs. A single female can lay up to 100 eggs in one nesting season. After around two months, hatchlings emerge and make their way to the ocean.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Green sea turtles are listed as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, accidental capture in fishing gear, and climate change. Conservation efforts include protecting nesting sites, reducing bycatch, and combating pollution.
