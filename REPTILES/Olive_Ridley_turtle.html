        <h1>Olive Ridley Turtle</h1>
    </header>

        <p>
            The <strong>Olive Ridley sea turtle</strong> (<i>Lepidochelys olivacea</i>) is one of the smallest and most abundant sea turtles in the world. Known for their unique mass nesting behavior, called <i>arribada</i>, Olive Ridley turtles play a vital role in marine ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Olive Ridley turtles are widely distributed in warm and tropical waters, primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Key nesting sites are found in countries like India, Mexico, and Costa Rica.
        </p>

            <tr>
                <td>Diet</td>
                <td>Omnivorous: feeds on jellyfish, crabs, and algae</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Nesting</h2>
        <p>
            Olive Ridley turtles are famous for their synchronized nesting behavior, known as <i>arribada</i>. During this event, thousands of females gather on the same beach to lay eggs, often returning to their natal beaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            Females can lay up to 100 eggs per clutch and typically nest 1-3 times during a season. Hatchlings face numerous challenges, including predators and environmental threats, as they make their way to the ocean.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Despite their large numbers, Olive Ridley turtles are classified as vulnerable due to threats such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bycatch in fishing nets</li>
            <li>Marine pollution</li>
            <li>Loss of nesting habitats</li>
            <li>Climate change</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Conservation efforts include protected nesting areas, reduced bycatch measures, and public awareness campaigns.
