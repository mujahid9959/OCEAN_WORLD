        <h1>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>
            The Leatherback sea turtle (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>) is the largest sea turtle species and is unique for its lack of a hard shell. Instead, its carapace is covered with a leathery, oil-saturated skin. This species plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Taxonomy and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Leatherbacks are distributed across the world's tropical and temperate oceans. They migrate thousands of kilometers each year between nesting and feeding grounds, often crossing entire ocean basins.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Characteristic</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Size</td>
                <td>6 to 7 feet in length</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>550 to 1,500 pounds</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Carapace</td>
                <td>Leathery and ridged, black with white spots</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flippers</td>
                <td>Longest of all sea turtles, up to 9 feet wide</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Leatherbacks primarily feed on jellyfish, playing a vital role in controlling jellyfish populations. They are deep divers, capable of reaching depths over 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) in search of prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Female Leatherbacks return to their natal beaches every 2 to 3 years to nest. A single female can lay up to 100 eggs in each clutch, and she nests multiple times in a single season.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Leatherback turtles are classified as vulnerable, with some subpopulations critically endangered. Threats include bycatch, marine pollution, climate change, and loss of nesting habitats. International conservation efforts aim to reduce these threats and protect critical habitats.
