        <h1>Manta Ray</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Manta Ray</strong> is a species of large rays belonging to the genus *Manta*, commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. They are known for their immense size, graceful swimming, and large, wing-like pectoral fins, which they use to glide through the water.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Manta rays can have wingspans that range from 3.5 meters to 7 meters, making them some of the largest rays in the world. Their bodies are flat and disc-shaped with large, triangular pectoral fins. Their heads are characterized by a pair of "cephalic lobes" that help funnel plankton and other small organisms into their mouths. Manta rays can weigh up to 1,350 kilograms (2,980 pounds).
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Manta rays are filter feeders, primarily eating plankton, small fish, and invertebrates. They use their cephalic lobes to channel food into their mouths as they swim through dense swarms of plankton. Their feeding behavior is often spectacular, as they can perform acrobatic rolls and somersaults to catch food.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Manta rays are social creatures and can often be seen in groups, though they are typically solitary when feeding. They are highly migratory, traveling long distances in search of food or suitable breeding grounds. Manta rays are usually found in coastal areas and offshore islands in tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Manta rays are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. They face numerous threats, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and the demand for their gill rakers in traditional medicine. Conservation efforts are focused on regulating fisheries, establishing marine protected areas, and raising awareness about their importance in marine ecosystems.
