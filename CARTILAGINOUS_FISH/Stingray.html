        <h1>Stingray</h1>

        <p>
            A <strong>Stingray</strong> is a type of flat-bodied fish belonging to the family *Dasyatidae*. They are closely related to sharks and are found primarily in shallow coastal waters of temperate seas, though some species can be found in deeper oceanic regions. Stingrays are known for their distinctive diamond-shaped bodies and long, whip-like tails, which often contain a venomous barb used for defense.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Stingrays have a flattened, circular body shape that aids in their bottom-dwelling lifestyle. They use their pectoral fins to "fly" through the water, and their tails are long and slender with a sharp spine capable of injecting venom. The tail barb is used for defense, not for hunting. Stingrays can vary greatly in size, from the smaller species that grow to around 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length to the larger species that can exceed 3 meters (10 feet).
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Stingrays are generally carnivorous and feed on a diet of small fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and invertebrates. They use their flattened bodies to burrow into the sand, exposing their prey. Their mouth is located on the underside of their body, and they have strong, flat teeth that are adapted for crushing shells.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Stingrays are often found on the ocean floor, blending in with the sand or mud for camouflage. They are typically solitary creatures but may occasionally gather in groups, particularly in shallow waters. Some species migrate seasonally, while others stay in the same habitat year-round. Stingrays are found in both tropical and temperate waters around the world, including the Mediterranean, the Americas, and Southeast Asia.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Many species of stingrays are considered vulnerable or endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Efforts are underway to protect stingray populations through regulations on fishing practices and the establishment of marine protected areas. Some regions have also banned the use of stingray products in the trade industry.
