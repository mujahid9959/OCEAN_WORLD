        <h1>Great White Shark</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Great White Shark</strong> (Carcharodon carcharias) is a large predatory fish known for its size, strength, and sharp teeth. It is one of the most well-known species of sharks, often featured in popular media. The Great White is found in coastal waters of all the major oceans, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Great White Sharks are known for their robust body, long conical snout, and large triangular teeth. Adult sharks can grow up to 20 feet (6 meters) in length and weigh up to 2.5 tons. They are typically a grayish color on top and white underneath, which provides camouflage when seen from above and below.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            The Great White Shark is typically found in temperate coastal waters, where it can hunt seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. They prefer areas with abundant food and can be seen near the surface, although they also dive to deeper waters when hunting.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Great White Sharks are apex predators, primarily feeding on marine mammals like seals, sea lions, and dolphins. They are known for their powerful bite, which they use to incapacitate their prey before eating. The shark's diet also includes fish and carrion.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Despite their reputation, Great White Sharks are not typically aggressive toward humans. Most attacks are believed to be cases of mistaken identity, where the shark bites to explore or defend itself. They are solitary creatures but may come together in specific areas for mating.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The Great White Shark is currently listed as vulnerable due to overfishing, habitat loss, and accidental catches in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the species, including bans on shark finning and the establishment of marine protected areas.
