        <h1>Skatefish</h1>

        <p>
            A <strong>Skatefish</strong> refers to a type of ray-finned fish in the family *Rajidae*. Skatefish are closely related to rays and sharks, known for their flattened bodies and wing-like pectoral fins. They inhabit ocean floors in temperate and cold waters around the world, where they are well-adapted to living on the seabed.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Skatefish have broad, flattened bodies resembling a kite, with wing-like pectoral fins that allow them to glide gracefully across the ocean floor. Their tails are long and slender, often with thorny structures. Skates differ from rays in that their pelvic fins are typically larger, and their tail lacks the venomous spine found in many ray species.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Skatefish are carnivorous, feeding primarily on invertebrates such as crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish. They use their specialized snouts to detect prey buried in the sand. They have sharp, flat teeth designed for crushing their prey's hard shells.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Skatefish are bottom-dwellers, often found on the seafloor in shallow or deep waters depending on the species. They use their pectoral fins to "fly" just above the ocean floor, where they feed and seek shelter. Skates are usually solitary, although some species can form schools in certain regions. They are primarily nocturnal hunters.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Most species of skatefish lay eggs in leathery capsules, often called "mermaid's purses." These eggs are deposited on the seafloor, where they are left to incubate until the young skates hatch. Some species may also give live birth, though egg-laying is more common across the family.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            While some species of skatefish are considered abundant, others are threatened due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Skates are often caught accidentally as bycatch in commercial fishing operations. Conservation efforts include better management of fisheries and marine protected areas.
