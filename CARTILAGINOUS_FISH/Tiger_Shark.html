            The <strong>Tiger Shark</strong> (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a large predator found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. It is known for its distinct tiger-like stripes, which fade as the shark matures. The Tiger Shark is famous for its diverse diet, often eating a variety of marine animals, including fish, squid, and even other sharks.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The Tiger Shark has a robust, cylindrical body with a blunt, rounded snout. Its back is typically gray or blue, adorned with dark vertical stripes, giving it its characteristic "tiger" pattern. Adult Tiger Sharks can grow up to 16 feet (5 meters) in length, although they typically average around 10-14 feet.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Known as a "garbage eater," the Tiger Shark has a varied diet that includes fish, squid, marine mammals, birds, and even garbage such as tires or license plates. Its wide-ranging diet is facilitated by its strong jaws, capable of crushing hard prey like turtle shells and bone.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Tiger Sharks are solitary and primarily nocturnal hunters. They are known to roam in search of food and will often investigate unfamiliar objects in the water. While they do not actively target humans, attacks can occur due to their curiosity and feeding habits.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            The Tiger Shark is listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Overfishing, habitat degradation, and bycatch are the primary threats to this species. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting their habitats and regulating fishing practices.
