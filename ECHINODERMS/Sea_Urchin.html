        <p>
            A <strong>sea urchin</strong> is a small, spiny, globular animal found on the seafloor. Belonging to the class Echinoidea, sea urchins are related to starfish and sand dollars. They have a hard shell or "test" made of calcium carbonate, covered by spines. Sea urchins are found in oceans worldwide, from shallow waters to deep ocean floors.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Sea urchins are round or oval in shape, and their bodies are encased in a hard shell called a "test." The surface of the test is often covered with long spines, which provide protection from predators. Sea urchins have tube feet for movement, a unique jaw structure known as Aristotle's lantern for feeding, and they possess a range of colors, from purple and red to black.

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            Sea urchins are primarily herbivores, feeding on algae and other plant material found on the seafloor. They use their tube feet to move around and their spines for defense. Sea urchins play a vital role in marine ecosystems by controlling algae populations, which can otherwise overwhelm coral reefs. However, in the absence of predators, they can become overpopulated and damage the ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Most sea urchins reproduce sexually, with males and females releasing their gametes into the water for external fertilization. The larvae undergo several stages of development before settling on the seafloor as juvenile sea urchins.

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea urchins can live up to 30 years in the wild, though many species have shorter lifespans.</li>
            <li>They have the ability to regenerate lost spines, tube feet, and even parts of their test.</li>
            <li>Sea urchins have been consumed as a delicacy in some cultures, particularly in Japan, where their roe is known as "uni."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Sea Urchins</h2>
        <p>
            There are over 900 species of sea urchins. Some notable types include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purple Sea Urchin</strong> (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) - Found along the west coast of North America.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Spined Sea Urchin</strong> (Diadema antillarum) - Known for its long, slender spines.</li>
            <li><strong>Red Sea Urchin</strong> (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) - A large species found along the Pacific coast of North America.</li>
