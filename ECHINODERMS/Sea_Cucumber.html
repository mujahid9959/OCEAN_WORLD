        <p>
            A <strong>sea cucumber</strong> is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Holothuroidea. These animals are soft-bodied, cylindrical creatures that resemble cucumbers, hence their name. They are found on the seafloor and are part of the echinoderm family, related to starfish, sea urchins, and sand dollars.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Sea cucumbers come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, but all share a soft, leathery body that is elongated and cylindrical. They often have five radial "ambulacral" grooves that run along the length of their body. Some species are capable of secreting toxins as a defense mechanism, while others possess the ability to regenerate body parts, including their internal organs.
        </p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Ecology and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Sea cucumbers play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients back into the environment. They feed on detritus, plankton, and organic matter that settles on the seafloor. This process helps to clean the ocean floor and promote the health of coral reefs and other ecosystems. Some species also have a symbiotic relationship with other marine animals, such as cleaner fish or certain crustaceans.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Sea cucumbers reproduce through both sexual and asexual methods. Many species release eggs and sperm into the water for external fertilization. Some species can also reproduce asexually by regenerating parts of their body, and in rare cases, a single animal can split in two to form two individuals.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea cucumbers have the ability to eject their internal organs as a defense mechanism, a process known as "evisceration." The organs can regenerate over time.</li>
            <li>Sea cucumbers are an important food source in some cultures, particularly in Asia, where they are considered a delicacy.</li>
            <li>Some species of sea cucumber are capable of bioluminescence, emitting light when disturbed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Sea Cucumbers</h2>
        <p>
            There are over 1,700 species of sea cucumbers, and they can be classified into different families based on their characteristics and habitat. Some notable types include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black Sea Cucumber</strong> (Holothuria leucospilota) - Found in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
            <li><strong>Green Sea Cucumber</strong> (Holothuria scabra) - Known for its edible body and often harvested for consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiky Sea Cucumber</strong> (Thelenota ananas) - Characterized by its large size and spiny texture.</li>
        </ul>
