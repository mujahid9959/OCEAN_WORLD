        <p>
            A <strong>brittle star</strong> (also known as an <em>ophiuroid</em>) is a type of echinoderm closely related to sea stars (starfish) but differs in its long, slender arms, which allow it to move much more quickly. They are found in a wide range of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to deep ocean floors. Brittle stars have a central disk with five or more long arms that can break off as a defense mechanism when threatened.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Brittle stars typically have a small, disk-shaped body with long, flexible arms that can be up to 10 times the diameter of the body. Unlike sea stars, brittle stars use their arms to move, and they are capable of rapid movement by jerking their arms in a coordinated manner. Their arms are highly flexible, and they have a small central body with no visible structures such as eyes or spines.
        </p>

        <h2>Ecology and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Brittle stars are scavengers and filter feeders. They use their arms to gather food, such as plankton, detritus, and small organic matter. They have a highly developed ability to regenerate lost arms and use their flexible limbs to escape predators. Brittle stars are primarily nocturnal and hide under rocks or debris during the day.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Brittle stars reproduce through external fertilization, where males release sperm into the water and females release eggs. The fertilized eggs develop into larvae, which eventually settle on the seafloor and transform into adult brittle stars. Some species can also reproduce asexually through fission, where the central disk splits, each part regenerating into a new individual.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brittle stars can regenerate their arms if they lose them to predators or accidents.</li>
            <li>They are often found in large colonies, where they form dense aggregations on the seafloor.</li>
            <li>Some species are bioluminescent, emitting light to attract mates or scare off predators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Brittle Stars</h2>
        <p>
            There are many species of brittle stars, with the most common including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Common Brittle Star</strong> (Ophioderma brevispinum) - Found in shallow waters.</li>
            <li><strong>Large-Bodied Brittle Star</strong> (Ophioderma longicauda) - Known for its larger size and distinct arms.</li>
            <li><strong>Green Brittle Star</strong> (Ophioderma virens) - A species that lives in tropical and subtropical environments.</li>
        </ul>
