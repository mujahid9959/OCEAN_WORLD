        <p>
            A <strong>sand dollar</strong> is a flattened, burrowing sea urchin found in shallow coastal waters. They belong to the order Clypeasteroida, and their round, disk-shaped body is easily recognizable. Sand dollars get their name from their coin-like appearance, and their skeleton (test) is often found washed up on beaches, where it is highly prized by collectors.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Sand dollars have a round, flat shape and are typically about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Their surface is covered with short spines and fine, velvety texture. These spines are used for locomotion and help the sand dollar move through the sand. The underside of the sand dollar has five distinct "petal-like" grooves that are part of its digestive system.

        <h2>Ecology and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Sand dollars play an important role in their ecosystem by helping to break down organic material on the ocean floor. They primarily feed on small particles of plankton, algae, and detritus that they collect from the sediment. These creatures are often seen burrowing in the sand to hide from predators such as crabs and fish.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Sand dollars reproduce sexually by releasing eggs and sperm into the water for external fertilization. The larvae hatch into free-swimming forms that eventually settle on the seafloor and undergo metamorphosis into adult sand dollars.

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sand dollars are often found on beaches, where their white, chalky skeletons are highly valued by beachcombers.</li>
            <li>The markings on the surface of sand dollars are often mistaken for designs, but they are actually remnants of the animal's feeding system.</li>
            <li>They are part of the class Echinoidea, which also includes sea urchins, sea stars, and other echinoderms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Sand Dollars</h2>
        <p>
            There are several species of sand dollars, with the most common being:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Common Sand Dollar</strong> (Dendraster excentricus) - Found along the west coast of North America.</li>
            <li><strong>Atlantic Sand Dollar</strong> (Echinarachnius parma) - Found in the Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
            <li><strong>Blue Sand Dollar</strong> (Encope michelini) - A smaller, blue-colored species found in the Gulf of California.</li>
