        <p>
            A <strong>starfish</strong> (also known as a sea star) is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Asteroidea. Starfish are known for their star-like shape and are found in oceans around the world. Despite their name, starfish are not fish but echinoderms, closely related to sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Starfish typically have a central disc and five (or more) arms that radiate out from the center. Their bodies are covered in spines or tubercles that provide protection. They have a unique water vascular system that helps them move and feed. Starfish are capable of regenerating lost limbs, and some species can even grow a whole new body from a single arm.

            <tr>

                <td>Color</td>
                <td>Varies widely: red, orange, purple, blue, green, etc.</td>

                <td>Habitat</td>
                <td>Seafloor in shallow coastal waters to deep ocean floors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Diet</td>
                <td>Primarily carnivorous, feeding on mollusks, corals, and detritus</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            Starfish are slow-moving and use their tube feet (part of the water vascular system) to crawl along the ocean floor. They are carnivores, feeding mostly on mollusks such as clams and oysters. They have an extraordinary feeding mechanism: they can extrude their stomachs out of their bodies to digest food externally before ingesting it.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Starfish reproduce through both sexual and asexual means. Most species reproduce sexually by releasing eggs and sperm into the water. Some species can also reproduce asexually by regenerating a new body from a single arm or a part of the central disc.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Starfish do not have a brain but instead have a nerve ring that controls their movements.</li>
            <li>Some species of starfish are able to regenerate lost limbs, and in some cases, a whole new starfish can grow from a single arm.</li>
            <li>The largest species of starfish, the <i>Sunflower Star</i> (Pycnopodia helianthoides), can have up to 24 arms and grow to a size of over 1 meter across.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Starfish</h2>
        <p>
            There are over 2,000 species of starfish, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Common Starfish</strong> (Asterias rubens) - A widespread species found in the North Atlantic.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunflower Star</strong> (Pycnopodia helianthoides) - Known for its many arms and large size.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Chip Starfish</strong> (Protoreaster nodosus) - Named for the distinctive "chocolate chip" markings on its arms.</li>
        </ul>
