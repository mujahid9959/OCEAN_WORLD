        <p>
            The <strong>King Crab</strong> is a large marine crustacean found primarily in cold seas. Known for its impressive size and delicious taste, the King Crab is both a vital part of its ecosystem and a prized delicacy in seafood cuisine. The most common and commercially valuable species include the Red King Crab (<em>Paralithodes camtschaticus</em>), Blue King Crab, and Golden King Crab.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            King Crabs have a robust, spiny exoskeleton that protects their soft body. They are easily recognized by their long legs and wide carapace, making them one of the largest crustaceans in the world.

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            King Crabs inhabit cold waters, particularly in the northern Pacific Ocean near Alaska and Russia. They are benthic creatures, dwelling on the ocean floor and preferring sandy or muddy substrates.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            King Crabs are opportunistic feeders, consuming a variety of foods including mollusks, worms, small fish, and detritus. Their powerful claws help them crush and capture prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Lifecycle and Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            King Crabs undergo a complex lifecycle involving multiple larval stages before reaching adulthood. Females can carry tens of thousands of eggs under their abdomen, which hatch into planktonic larvae.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
            King Crabs are highly sought after in the fishing industry, particularly Red King Crabs, which are considered a delicacy. Their fisheries are tightly regulated to prevent overharvesting and ensure sustainability.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
