    <main>
        <p>
            The <strong>barnacle</strong> is a type of crustacean found in marine environments. They are best known for their hard, calcareous shell and for their tendency to attach themselves to various surfaces such as rocks, ships' hulls, and even other marine animals. Barnacles are sessile, meaning they remain fixed in one place throughout their lives.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Barnacles have a hard, protective outer shell made of calcium carbonate. They typically have six calcareous plates that enclose their body, forming a sturdy structure that protects them from predators and environmental factors. They also have a pair of antennae, known as cirri, which they use to filter feed.

                <td>Attached to rocks, ships, and other hard surfaces in tidal and subtidal zones</td>

                <td>Diet</td>
                <td>Filter feeders, consuming plankton and organic particles from the water</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            Barnacles are highly adapted to life in the intertidal zone, where they endure periods of submersion and exposure to air. They secrete a strong adhesive cement to attach themselves securely to surfaces. Once they have settled, they remain attached throughout their adult life, using their cirri to filter plankton and small particles from the water. 
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Barnacles are hermaphrodites, meaning each individual has both male and female reproductive organs. However, most barnacles engage in cross-fertilization. They release their eggs into the water, where they are fertilized externally. The larvae eventually undergo a metamorphosis to become juvenile barnacles and seek out a suitable surface to attach to.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The glue that barnacles produce is one of the strongest biological adhesives known to science.</li>
            <li>Barnacles can live for many years and can form dense colonies on a variety of surfaces.</li>
            <li>Some species of barnacles can grow on the hulls of ships, leading to drag and fuel inefficiencyâ€”a problem known as "biofouling."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Barnacles</h2>
        <p>
            There are many species of barnacles, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acorn Barnacle</strong> - One of the most common types found on hard surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Gooseneck Barnacle</strong> - Known for its long, flexible stalk.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalpellomorpha</strong> - A group of barnacles with a flat, shield-like appearance.</li>
