        <h1>Hermit Crab</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Hermit Crab</strong> is a group of crustaceans belonging to the superfamily Paguroidea. Unlike most crabs, hermit crabs do not have a hard, protective shell; instead, they use discarded shells from other animals, like snails, to protect their soft abdomen.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Hermit crabs are known for their small size and soft, coiled abdomen that requires protection from predators. They typically have ten legs, with the first pair modified into large claws, which they use for defense and manipulating objects.
        </p>

                <td>Habitat</td>
                <td>Coastal areas, under rocks, in burrows</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Diet</td>
                <td>Omnivorous, feeds on detritus, plants, and small invertebrates</td>
            </tr>

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            Hermit crabs are social animals, often found in groups, and they frequently engage in shell "exchanges" where individuals compete for the best-fitting shells. They are primarily nocturnal and will scavenge for food at night. These crabs are important scavengers in their ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Species</h2>
        <p>
            There are over 1,000 species of hermit crabs, ranging from marine to terrestrial varieties. Some of the most well-known species include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Caribbean hermit crab</strong> (<em>Coenobita clypeatus</em>) - Often kept as pets.</li>
            <li><strong>Red-clawed hermit crab</strong> (<em>Coenobita brevimanus</em>) - Found in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
            <li><strong>Marine hermit crab</strong> (<em>Pagurus bernhardus</em>) - Commonly found along European coasts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hermit crabs reproduce sexually, with external fertilization. The female releases eggs, which are fertilized by the male. The eggs hatch into larvae that spend time in the plankton before settling to the ocean floor as juvenile crabs.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hermit crabs are known for their "shell fights" where they compete for shells.</li>
            <li>Some species of hermit crabs can live for over 30 years in the wild.</li>
            <li>Hermit crabs can switch shells when they grow or when they find a better one.</li>
