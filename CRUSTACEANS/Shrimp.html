        <p>
            The <strong>shrimp</strong> is a small, swimming crustacean found in both marine and freshwater environments. Known for their long, slender bodies and prominent antennae, shrimp play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as both predators and prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Shrimp typically have a translucent or light-colored exoskeleton, which they shed periodically through a process known as molting. Their bodies are segmented, with a head, thorax, and abdomen, and they possess five pairs of legs. Most shrimp species have a specialized pair of claws (chelae) for grabbing and handling food.

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            Shrimp are highly social animals and often form large groups or schools. They are generally nocturnal, foraging for food at night. Shrimp play an important role in the food web as both predators and prey. They are also essential in the process of decomposition, feeding on dead material and recycling nutrients.
        </p>

        <h2>Species</h2>
        <p>
            Shrimp species are numerous, with over 2,000 known varieties. Some of the most common species include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Penaeus vannamei</strong> - Also known as the whiteleg shrimp, widely farmed for consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Caridina multidentata</strong> - The Amano shrimp, popular in aquariums for algae control.</li>
            <li><strong>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</strong> - The giant river prawn, found in tropical and subtropical freshwater habitats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Shrimp reproduce through external fertilization, with females releasing eggs into the water, where they are fertilized by the male. The larvae hatch into planktonic forms, growing through several stages before settling to the bottom as juvenile shrimp.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp are known for their remarkable jumping ability, which they use to escape predators.</li>
            <li>Some species, like the pistol shrimp, can create a loud snapping noise with their claws to stun prey.</li>
            <li>Shrimp are an important food source for many marine species, including fish, birds, and humans.</li>
