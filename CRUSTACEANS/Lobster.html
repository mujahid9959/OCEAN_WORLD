        <p>
            The <strong>Lobster</strong> is a marine crustacean belonging to the family Nephropidae. Known for its hard exoskeleton and long, muscular tail, the lobster is both a significant part of marine ecosystems and a popular seafood delicacy worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Lobsters have a segmented body covered with a tough exoskeleton, which they periodically shed through molting. Their bodies are equipped with five pairs of legs, including two large, claw-like pincers used for defense and food capture.
        </p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Lobsters are found in oceans worldwide, primarily in rocky, sandy, or muddy coastal regions. They thrive in cold and temperate waters, with large populations in the Atlantic Ocean, including off the coasts of Maine and Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            Lobsters are scavengers and omnivores, feeding on fish, mollusks, algae, and other organic matter. Their powerful claws are used to crush shells and tear apart their prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Lifecycle and Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Lobsters reproduce sexually, with females laying thousands of eggs that they carry under their tail until they hatch. Lobster larvae go through several planktonic stages before settling on the seafloor as juveniles.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Lobsters are among the most valuable seafood products, especially in countries like the United States and Canada. The American Lobster (<em>Homarus americanus</em>) is a key species in commercial fisheries.
        </p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lobsters can regenerate lost limbs, such as claws or legs.</li>
            <li>They can live for over 50 years in the wild.</li>
            <li>Unlike most animals, lobsters exhibit "indeterminate growth," meaning they grow throughout their lives.</li>
