        <h1>Abalone</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Abalone</strong> is a type of marine mollusk from the family Haliotidae. They are known for their distinctive, iridescent shells, which feature holes or perforations along the edge. The flesh of abalone is considered a delicacy in many parts of the world, and the shells are highly valued for decorative purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Abalones have a single, spirally coiled shell that is often colorful, with a strong iridescent surface. The size of the shell can vary depending on the species, but it is generally oval-shaped with a flat underside. The shell is adorned with small holes that help with respiration and water circulation. The mollusk itself has a large, muscular foot used for movement.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Abalones are primarily found in shallow coastal waters, attached to rocks or reefs. They are distributed along the coasts of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with abundant populations in places like California, South Africa, New Zealand, and Japan.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Abalones are herbivores, primarily feeding on algae and other plant material found on rocks in their environment. They use their muscular foot to cling to surfaces while they graze on algae, especially kelp.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic and Cultural Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Abalones are highly prized for both their meat and shells. They are a significant part of the seafood industry, especially in regions like Japan, where abalone is considered a delicacy. Abalone shells are often used in jewelry, ornaments, and decorative pieces due to their unique, iridescent beauty.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Overfishing, illegal poaching, and habitat destruction have led to declining populations of abalone, particularly in regions like Southern California. Conservation efforts, including sustainable farming practices and marine protected areas, have been implemented to help preserve abalone populations.
