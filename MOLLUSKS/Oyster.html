        <p>
            The <strong>Oyster</strong> is a type of mollusk from the family Ostreidae. It is known for its hard, irregularly shaped shell and its ability to filter water. Oysters are widely known for their culinary value, often served raw on the half shell or used in cooked dishes.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Oysters have a rough, asymmetrical shell that is often dark in color. The shells are typically composed of calcium carbonate and are made up of two valves that are hinged together. Inside the shell, the oyster has soft, edible flesh. Oysters vary in size, with some species growing to several inches in length.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Oysters are primarily found in coastal and estuarine waters, living in intertidal zones, attached to rocks, or growing in clusters on oyster reefs. They can be found in oceans worldwide, including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
        </p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Oysters are filter feeders, meaning they feed by filtering plankton and other microscopic organisms from the water. They use their gills to filter large volumes of water, extracting nutrients and oxygen in the process.
        </p>

        <h2>Culinary Uses</h2>
        <p>
            Oysters are a popular delicacy in many parts of the world, especially in coastal regions. They can be eaten raw, grilled, baked, or fried. Oysters are prized for their unique taste and are often served with lemon, sauces, or cocktail dips.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic and Ecological Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Oysters play a vital role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and improving water quality. They are also important to the economy, particularly in the seafood industry, as they provide food and contribute to aquaculture practices.
