        <h1>Cone Snail</h1>

        <p>
            The <strong>Cone Snail</strong> (family: Conidae) is a group of predatory and venomous marine snails, which are known for their beautifully patterned, conical shells. These snails are commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters and are famous for their potent venom, which they use to capture prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Cone snails are named for the shape of their shells, which resemble cones. Their shells can come in various colors, patterns, and sizes, and some species can grow quite large. The snails use a specialized radula (a toothed tongue) and a venomous harpoon-like tooth to inject toxins into their prey.
        </p>

        <h2>Venom</h2>
        <p>
            Cone snails are notorious for their venom, which they use to immobilize and digest their prey, which primarily consists of fish, marine worms, and other snails. The venom is a complex mixture of toxins that can be dangerous to humans. In fact, some species, such as the geographic cone snail (*Conus geographus*), are known to be deadly to humans.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Cone snails live primarily in warm, shallow waters, often hiding in sand or coral reefs. They can be found in the Indo-Pacific region, the Caribbean, and along the coastlines of many tropical countries.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Like most snails, cone snails reproduce by laying eggs. The larvae develop into free-swimming forms before eventually settling down to become adult snails. Their reproductive process is typical for marine gastropods.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            While some species of cone snails are common and widespread, others are threatened due to overfishing and habitat destruction. Efforts are being made to better understand these fascinating creatures and their ecosystems.
