        <p>
            The <strong>Giant Clam</strong> (scientific name: <i>Tridacna gigas</i>) is a large marine bivalve mollusk that inhabits coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. It is the largest living species of clam and can weigh over 200 kilograms (440 lbs) and grow to a length of more than 1.2 meters (4 feet).
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Giant clams are known for their large, colorful shells, which can be blue, green, or brown, and their ability to grow to enormous sizes. Their vibrant coloration comes from the symbiotic relationship they have with algae, called zooxanthellae, which live in the clam's tissues and provide nutrients through photosynthesis.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            These clams are found in shallow waters, typically in coral reef environments. They thrive in warm, tropical waters with a depth of up to 20 meters (66 feet), and are commonly found in areas like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
        </p>

        <h2>Feeding</h2>
        <p>
            Giant clams are filter feeders, using their gills to capture plankton and other small particles from the water. However, they also rely heavily on their symbiotic algae, which help provide them with food through photosynthesis.
        </p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
            Giant clams reproduce sexually by releasing eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. Their larvae then undergo a planktonic stage before settling onto the reef to begin growing.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and the aquarium trade, the Giant Clam is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are in place to protect their natural habitats and prevent their exploitation.
