        <p>
            The <strong>Nautilus</strong> is a marine cephalopod mollusk, known for its spiral-shaped shell. It is often referred to as a "living fossil" because it has changed very little over millions of years. Nautiluses belong to the family Nautilidae, and their most distinctive feature is their external, chambered shell.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Nautiluses have a coiled shell that is divided into a series of chambers. As they grow, they move into larger chambers, and the shell becomes more spiral in shape. The shell helps them control buoyancy and stay afloat. The nautilus has tentacles around its head, and they are equipped with suckers for capturing prey. The nautilus does not have an ink sac, unlike other cephalopods like squids and octopuses.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Nautiluses are found in deep, tropical, and subtropical waters in the Indo-Pacific region, including areas around Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. They prefer depths of around 200 to 500 meters (660 to 1,640 feet), where they live in caves or beneath overhangs.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            Nautiluses are solitary animals, spending most of their time in deep waters. They are nocturnal and primarily scavengers, feeding on fish, crabs, and dead organic matter. Nautiluses are known for their slow movement and reliance on their shell for protection from predators.
        </p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
            Several species of nautilus are considered threatened due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and the collection of their shells for ornamental purposes. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these ancient creatures and regulate their trade.
